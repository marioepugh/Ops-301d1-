The reading is focused on ITIL 4 and the shift from change management and change control to change enablement. The purpose of change enablement is to maximize 
the number of successful IT changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing the change schedule.
 
A change is defined as the addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on services, typically including changes 
to IT infrastructure, applications, documentation, processes, supplier relationships and any other critical components of the service. 
 
ITIL has three different types of changes, standard, normal and emergency. Contribution of change enablement to the Service Value Chain includes plan, engage, 
design and transition, obtain/build, deliver and support and improve.
